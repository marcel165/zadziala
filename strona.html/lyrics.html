        Do you really wanna die as a virgin boy?
    Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, love
    Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, love
    Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, love
    Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, love
    Loving and liking
    They're just one and the same, same
    You're not that special
    I'm just playing the game, game
    "Hey, I'm sorry"
    Is that really what you want to hear me say?
    No way!
    Don't get all stressed and depressed over this, ok?
    'K? 'K? 'K?
    Stop!
    Don't you know, never wanting any more is rule number one?
    (I told you)
    Right from the start not to give it any heart, it's only for fun
    (How could you?)
    Mr. Commitment, you can find the exit over to the right
    Oh my, are you really staying for the night?
    Hop, step, and
    One more chance!
    So if it's appeal, keep it real, baby shake that
    Pop in a feel, and keep going like that
    Don't be a creep, that's some weird jealousy
    You thirsty for me?
    Could you stop being cringy?
    If you really want some, if you're gettin' lonely
    Baby, get lucky (baby, get lucky)
    Hated to love, but it only gave me life
    Are you really gonna die as a virgin boy?
    If it's appeal, keep it real, baby shake that
    Down with the feels?
    With a face screaming down bad?
    "Love you!" (I don't)
    Gross, I'm going limp
    Are you out of your mind?
    Ugh, you're such a simp!
    If you really want some, if you're gettin' lonely
    Baby, get lucky (baby, get lucky)
    I fell in love, and it made me such a bore
    So I'm gonna do my own thing and you do yours, alright?
    Sure
    Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
    Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
    Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
    Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
    Bursting rubber, we're instant lovers
    And under the covers
    We smother each other and
    It's no dilemma, come dear, you gotta
    'Cuz once you recover
    We'll go for another
    This Vampire's a talented sucker!

    Oh, if it's appeal, keep it real, baby shake that
    How many years has it been since I felt like
    Sorry to call you a creep, that's on me
    I'm thirsty for love, but I'm downing a beer like
    If you really want some, if you're gettin' lonely
    Baby, get lucky (baby, get lucky)
    I fell in love, and I wanted something more
    So I'm gonna do my own thing and you do yours, ok?
    Sure!
    My my my, you're just a little freak
    (Like I thought)
    Why why why, you're just the same as me
    (Oh my god!)
    Right right right, it's time to start the show
    Once more, deeper into this rabbit hole we go
    My my my, you're just a little freak

    Once more, deeper into this rabbit hole we go
    So gross!
